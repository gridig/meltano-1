## üíª CLI Superpowers

The primary interface to Meltano Cloud is the command line. Cloud is an extension of the great experience Meltano Core users are used to, but with new commands. These include commands to view your job history, manage your schedules, and view logs.

Checkout the docs to see what you can do on Cloud.

## üçá Multiple Projects, Multiple Deployments

At Meltano we believe your data platform is, at the end of the day, a software project. This means you should be able to benefit from software development best practices such as isolated environments.

Meltano Cloud leverages the Environments feature of Meltano Core to generate your Deployments. Cloud Deployments are the combination of an Environment and a git branch. On Cloud you‚Äôre able to define as many Deployments as you need and execute your schedules how and where you need.

We also support running multiple Projects with the same Cloud account. This gives users the choice on how to setup their data platform to best suit their needs.
